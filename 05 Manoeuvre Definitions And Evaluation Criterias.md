    water as a Synchro Ground Spiral.

-   Height of wing tip below 3m at the lowest point.

-   Entry (speed, sink rate), height of wing tip over water (touch for
    maximum score) in close proximity to each other.

Wingovers Cruzado Outside Landing

-   Same criteria as Wingovers Cruzados.

-   Minimum one pendulum to each side.

-   After the last outside pendulum connection to a spiral till the
    water as a Ground Spiral performed individually.

-   Height of wing tip below 3m at the lowest point.

-   Entry (speed, sink rate), height of wing tip over water (touch for
    maximum score).

Pitch Pendulum Landing

-   Rapid and synchronized entry. Pilots should be vertically aligned
    for maximum score.

-   Minimum twice, one over the other.

-   The lower pilot must be less than 3m over the water in the last
    pitch, 1m or less over the water for maximum score.

## Choreography

Maneuver

-   Technical evaluation criteria

Placement and Drift

-   For maximum score: start the programme considering the drift of the
    routine and finish with enough altitude for the (+ spiral) landing
    approaching the raft.

Management of Altitude

-   Managing all manoeuvres of the programme and using all the altitude
    available.

Flow

-   Each manoeuvre has to be flown fluently with good energy management.

Rhythm and Connection

-   Good energy management between the manoeuvres and smooth
    connections.

Originality and Diversity

> Innovative and varied use of spin/stall/dynamic maneuvers. Also moving
> to both sides left and right. Using different entries for manoeuvres.
> Appeal to public.

Synchro Coordination

-   Maintain the same altitude when performing the manoeuvres. Staying
    in close proximity to each other. Starting/ending manoeuvres
    simultaneously.
