<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction-and-flight-definitions"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> INTRODUCTION AND FLIGHT DEFINITIONS</h1>
<p>Section 7B of the FAI Sporting Code is the subset of Section 7 (or “Section 7 Common”) dedicated to Paragliding Aerobatics Championships. This document must be read in conjunction with the Section 7 Common, Section 7I Guidelines and Templates, Section 7E WPRS (CIVL Ranking) and the General Section.</p>
<p>This document defines rules for 1st Category Events. For 2nd Category Events, see Section 7 Common Chapter 12.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="flight-definitions"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Flight Definitions</h2>
<p>Additional definitions relevant to paragliding can be found in the Section 7A Cross Country.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.1" id="flight-box"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Flight Box</h3>
<p>A three dimensional virtual and variable space, within which all maneuvers must take place. The flight box includes an area over the water where a pilot must land in case he loses control of his glider or throws his reserve parachute. The size and shape of the flight box is highly dependent on weather conditions, especially wind drift. It is the pilot’s responsibility to monitor conditions closely during his flight in order to ensure he is in, and stays in, the flight box during all maneuvers.</p>
<p>The overall flight box area is defined and described during the General Briefing. It may be adjusted later during the event.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.2" id="no-fly-zone"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> No-fly Zone</h3>
<p>The area over which flying is strictly forbidden at all times, irrespective of wind conditions. The no-fly zone is defined during the General Briefing and may be adjusted later during the event.</p>
<p>In the case where the Flight Box includes part of a No-Fly Zone, the rules of the No-Fly Zone prevail.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="entry-and-registration"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> ENTRY AND REGISTRATION</h1>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="entry"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Entry</h2>
<p>The Local Regulations shall state:</p>
<p>The maximum number of pilots that may be accepted in the Solo Championship.</p>
<p>The maximum number of pairs of pilots that may be accepted in the Synchro Championship.</p>
<p>The maximum number of pilots that may be entered by a NAC.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="eligibility-to-compete"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Eligibility to Compete</h2>
<p>In the 5 years preceding the start of the Championships:</p>
<p>Men shall have scored a minimum of 25 WPRS points</p>
<p>Women shall have scored a minimum of 20 WPRS points</p>
<p>Synchro pairs must demonstrate their skill either in a previous event or just prior to the championship.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.1" id="exemption-to-eligibility-to-compete"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Exemption to Eligibility to Compete</h3>
<p>For any exemptions to pilot qualification requirements, applications must be made by the pilot’s NAC, with supporting evidence of the pilot’s skill and competition history. It is the responsibility of the NAC to ensure this is received by the CIVL President at least 30 days before the start of the competition.</p>
<p>The list of exempted pilots is published on the organizer’s website.</p>
<p>The Meet Director, before the start of the competition, may request an exempted pilot or a Synchro pair, to participate in a safety selection to demonstrate the skills defined in 2.2.1.1. In agreement with the Safety Director and Chief Judge, he may refuse entry to the competition if the pilot or the pair is unable to demonstrate these skills.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.2.1.1" id="safety-selection"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.1</span> Safety Selection</h4>
<p>All pilots entering the competition shall be able to safely perform the following maneuvers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Full stall + exit</p></li>
<li><p>Tail slide + exit</p></li>
<li><p>Wingover</p></li>
<li><p>SAT</p></li>
<li><p>Helicopter</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All pilots entering the competition shall be able to demonstrate the following points of choreography:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Placement and drift</p></li>
<li><p>Management of altitude</p></li>
<li><p>Flow, rhythm, connection</p></li>
<li><p>Synchro co-ordination (only for synchro flights)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="2.2.2" id="qualification-dates"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Qualification Dates</h3>
<p>Pilot qualifications must be finalized 30 days before the start of the championship.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.3" id="procedure-for-checking-qualification"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Procedure for Checking Qualification</h3>
<p>Qualification is to be checked by four parties to avoid unnecessary travel, expenses and disappointment in the event that a pilot’s entry is rejected due to not meeting the qualification criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The NAC or National Association/Federation before selecting their pilots.</p></li>
<li><p>The competition organiser.</p></li>
<li><p>The pilot.</p></li>
<li><p>The CIVL Screening Committee.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="2.2.4" id="civl-screening-committee"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> CIVL Screening Committee</h3>
<p>A Screening Committee is appointed by CIVL Bureau for each championship. It consists of three people: one representing the Bureau, one representing the Aerobatics Committee, and a Senior Judge.</p>
<p>The screening committee shall:</p>
<p>Check that entries accepted by the organizer meet eligibility to compete criteria. Notify the organizer promptly of any that do not, so that the pilot can apply for an exemption under 2.2.1.</p>
<p>Accept and check applications for exemptions. Request additional information if needed, make decisions with safety in mind and inform NAC and organizers.</p>
<p>Check that the allocation process is effected according to the rules.</p>
<p>It is each pilot's responsibility to make sure he is qualified.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.5" id="organisers-responsibility"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Organiser’s Responsibility</h3>
<p>It is the organizer’s responsibility to notify NACs of any pilots who do not appear to meet the qualification criteria.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="allocation"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Allocation</h2>
<p>The nation ranking for this purpose shall be the WPRS Nation Ranking three calendar months before the championship starts.</p>
<p>Places are allocated to nations, one by one, in order from the top nation in the WPRS nation ranking down to the last ranked nation; if any places are still available, the process starts at the top again.</p>
<p>This process will continue until the maximum number of pilots is reached or until 60 days before the start of the championship or otherwise stated in the local regulations.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3.1" id="mixed-championships"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Mixed Championships</h3>
<p>The base for all nations is one male pilot plus one female pilot (1+1).</p>
<p>The allocation is done according to 2.3, but in this process the place allocated to the one female pilot in the base team size cannot be filled by a male pilot in any round of allocation.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3.2" id="host-nation"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Host nation</h3>
<p>The host nation shall have the opportunity of entering the same number of pilots as the top nation, except that in mixed championships they may not enter males as substitutes for females with places allocated under the 1+1 rule (see 2.3.1).</p>
<p>Current World and Continental Champions, men and women, who are allowed a discretionary entry to defend their title if not selected as part of the national entry, are not taken into account in the number of pilots of the top nation</p>
<h2 data-number="2.4" id="registration"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Registration</h2>
<p>Each competitor will be required to present to the organizers upon registration:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Proof of identity.</p></li>
<li><p>Satisfactory evidence of equipment airworthiness.</p></li>
<li><p>Proof of valid insurance as detailed.</p></li>
<li><p>Each competitor will be requested to sign:</p></li>
<li><p>Waiver declaration (agreement on release of liability). See Section 7I Guidelines and Templates Chapter 12.</p></li>
<li><p>Certified glider statement. See Section 7I Guidelines and Templates Chapter 16.</p></li>
<li><p>Entry form.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each competitor will be requested to present his equipment to be checked by the Safety Director and/or a Senior Judge. In case of non-compliance (see Chapter 8), the pilot might not be accepted.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="runs"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> RUNS</h1>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="official-practice-period"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Official Practice Period</h2>

<p>Cuts are allowed after a minimum of 2 valid runs.</p>
<p>Cuts policy is decided by the Meet Director in agreement with the Chief Judge.</p>
<p>Cuts policy will be presented and discussed during the general briefing.</p>
<p>Cuts policy may evolve during the event depending on weather or other variable elements. In this case, it is presented during the daily briefing.</p>
<p>A pilot which has been cut must remain available until the end of the championship for show flights, otherwise he may be disqualified from the competitions.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="programs"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Programs</h2>
<p>Programs may be free, imposed or restricted.</p>
<p>In an imposed or restricted program, the Meet Director and/or the Chief Judge are entitled to specify technical limitations.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.4" id="pre-flyers"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Pre-Flyers</h2>
<p>Pre-flyers may be used at the discretion of the Meet Director.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.5" id="start-order"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Start Order</h2>
<p>The starting order of the first run is set by a random draw or the reverse order of the last updated WPRS. For subsequent runs, pilots/pairs will start in the reverse order of the last updated competition standing.</p>
<p>In case a pilot notices a technical problem to his equipment before taking off, the start marshal or drop master must be informed and a delay might be granted.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.6" id="announcement-of-program-start"><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Announcement of Program Start</h2>
<p>Before starting the program, every pilot/pair has to make one “big ear” to notify to the judges the start of the run.</p>
<p>If, before starting the first maneuver, he estimates the conditions unsafe or the altitude too low to complete the run, the judges are notified by making 2 “big ears”. Then the pilot has to fly down immediately to a safe landing without making any aerobatic maneuver.</p>
<p>The pilot/pair will be allowed a re-flight, except when judges estimate that the pilot/pair showed unsportsmanlike behavior: in this case, warning(s) might be issued. Nevertheless, it is always the pilot’s responsibility when to start his routine.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.7" id="flight-box-1"><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Flight Box</h2>
<p>Aerobatic maneuvers are only allowed in the flight box.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the flight box are explained during the general briefing, and when necessary, updated at the daily briefing. A detailed image clearly showing no-fly zones and the general area of the flight box will be permanently displayed on the official information board.</p>
<p>At take-off, information on the wind strength along the run and at landing must be provided and constantly updated.</p>
<p>The Meet Director, in agreement with the Safety Director and Chief Judge, define the maximum strength of wind acceptable. This is discussed at the general briefing.</p>
<p>It is strictly forbidden to fly over the public at any height (immediate elimination from the competition), even when the flight box technically extends over that area (no fly zone).</p>
<h2 data-number="3.8" id="emergency-stop-signal"><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Emergency Stop Signal</h2>
<p>In case of emergency, the flight box can be closed.</p>
<p>A sound signal (loud enough to be heard by pilots) and/or a visual signal (cross and additionally a smoke bomb can be used) over the raft to announce that all aerobatics maneuvers and all water landings must immediately stop. Pilots in the air must fly down and dry land safely.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.9" id="re-flight"><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> Re-flight</h2>
<p>The Meet Director or the Chief Judge may allow a re-flight if a pilot/pair has not been given the opportunity to make a scored run. In case of a re-flight the pilot/pair shall repeat the same maneuvers that had been flown prior to the moment the run was interrupted. When a pilot/pair is disturbed by any external factor during the landing (safety boat, unauthorized craft, swimmers etc.) only the landing will be repeated and scored, and will be preceded by the last maneuver flown during the interrupted run.</p>
<p>When, for any reason (weather, lack of time…), a re-flight cannot be granted during the final run of a competition, for this run the concerned pilots/pairs will be awarded the same score achieved by the pilot/pair ranked, in that same final run, at the position corresponding to the competition standings after the last completed run, provided that not more than 3 pilots/pairs are affected, and that none of them was ranked in the top 5 of the competition standings after the last validated run.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the final run is cancelled.</p>
<p>Example. After run 3, a pilot is 7th in the competition standings. He cannot complete the final run due to a thunderstorm. For run 4, he will be awarded the same points obtained by the pilot ranked 7th in run 4.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.10" id="validation-of-run"><span class="header-section-number">3.10</span> Validation of Run</h2>
<p>A run is valid if all competitors have been given the opportunity to make a scored flight.</p>
<p>In case of difficulties (meteorological conditions, logistics etc.), the Meet Director may decide to cancel or stop a run after consultation with the Safety Director, Chief Judge and Pilots' Committee.</p>
<p>If a run cannot be completed one day, it will be continued on the next scheduled day, provided that similar meteorological conditions prevail.</p>
<p>If the final run of a competition cannot be completed before the time limit agreed with the organizer, and the exception stated under 4.9 cannot be applied, the final run is cancelled and all scores obtained before the interruption are disregarded.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.11" id="communication"><span class="header-section-number">3.11</span> Communication</h2>
<p>Radios and / or mobile phones can be used for communication, including between pilots of the same pair. The start of the run must be communicated by operating staff to the judges who will acknowledge confirmation.</p>

Under certain conditions, the Chief Judge and/or Meet Director may choose to ignore this rule, in which case, information shall be provided at the briefing preceding that run.</p>
<p>In Synchro, when the two pilots perform the same maneuver simultaneously in opposite directions, (mirror) the maneuver is considered as neutral, without a specific direction of rotation.</p>
<p>For Rodeo SAT and Rodeo Helicopter, the rotation of the SAT or the helicopter will determine the direction of the maneuver.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.5.1.2" id="repetition-during-the-same-run."><span class="header-section-number">5.5.1.2</span> Repetition during the same run.</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Only one of the following manoeuvres can be performed during the same run: SuperStall to Infinite Tumbling, Flat Stall to Infinite Tumbling, Tail Slide / Deep Stall to Infinite Tumbling.</p></li>
<li><p>Only 2 tumbling, infinity and rhythmic related manoeuvres can be performed during the same run.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If this limitation is not respected, only the allowed maneuvers (in the order of execution) will be scored.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.5.1.3" id="deductions"><span class="header-section-number">5.5.1.3</span> Deductions</h4>
<p>The penalty for repetition is typically a reduction of 13% of the choreography mark for each repetition, but may be specified differently (especially for events where the completion of more than 4 runs is expected) and will be stated at the general briefing.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.5.1.4" id="exceptions-to-repetition"><span class="header-section-number">5.5.1.4</span> Exceptions to Repetition</h4>
<p>The following maneuvers can be performed more than once without penalty within the same competition: Tail Slide, Wingover, Full Stall, Dynamic Full Stall, Pitch Pendulum, Bro Hook. However, each maneuver can be performed only once twisted or flipped within the same run. If the same maneuver is repeated twisted or flipped within the same run, the extra choreography bonus will not be rewarded.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.5.2" id="twisted-manoeuvres-bonus"><span class="header-section-number">5.5.2</span> Twisted manoeuvres bonus</h3>
<p>During each run, up to 5 maneuvers can be performed twisted. They will be rewarded with “choreography twisted bonus” points in accordance with the listing found in 5.1. and 5.2.</p>
<p>Some maneuvers can be rewarded with an additional “choreography twisted exit bonus”.</p>
<p>If more than 5 maneuvers are flown twisted, the extra maneuvers will not be scored and their coefficients not taken into account for the determination of the average coefficient. All maneuvers allowed to be flown twisted in Solo can be performed twisted in Synchro.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.5.3" id="reversed-manoeuvres-bonus"><span class="header-section-number">5.5.3</span> Reversed Manoeuvres bonus</h3>
<p>During each run, up to 3 maneuvers can be performed reversed. They will be rewarded with “choreography reversed bonus” points in accordance with the listing found in 5.1. and 5.2.</p>
<p>If more than 3 maneuvers are flown reversed, the extra maneuvers will not be scored and their coefficients not taken into account for the determination of the average coefficient. All maneuvers allowed to be flown reversed in Solo can be performed reversed in Synchro.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.5.4" id="flipped-manoeuvres-bonus"><span class="header-section-number">5.5.4</span> Flipped Manoeuvres bonus</h3>
<p>During each run, up to 2 maneuvers can be performed flipped. They will be rewarded with “choreography flipped bonus” or “choreography double flipped bonus” points in accordance with the listing found in 5.1. and 5.2. If more than 2 maneuvers are flown flipped, the extra maneuvers will not be scored and their coefficients not taken into account for the determination of the average coefficient. All maneuvers allowed to be flown flipped in Solo can be performed flipped in Synchro.</p>
<p>If a flipped maneuver is to be performed, it must be announced before the run by personally informing one of the judges, or, at the latest before take-off, by requesting the start marshal or drop master to inform the judges.</p>
<p>Flip cannot be performed during the last 2 maneuvers of the run.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.5.5" id="twisted-exit-bonus"><span class="header-section-number">5.5.5</span> Twisted exit bonus</h3>
<p>The twisted exit bonus is awarded when a twisted maneuver is exit twisted and is followed by another twisted maneuver, without untwisting in between. Exception: the last maneuver of the run. In this case the trick has to be clearly exited twisted and controlled.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.5.6" id="wing-touch-bonus"><span class="header-section-number">5.5.6</span> Wing touch bonus</h3>
<p>The wing touch bonus is awarded when, during the execution of some synchro manoeuvres, the two wings smoothly touch each other. They will be rewarded with “choreography wing touch bonus” points in accordance with the listing found in 5.2.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.6" id="landing-2"><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Landing</h2>
<p>Landing on the raft is an integral part of the competition.</p>
<p>The raft must have a surface area of 25 square meters minimum on a lake, and larger when on sea water in order to protect, as much as possible, the glider from the salt.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.6.1" id="landing-on-ground"><span class="header-section-number">5.6.1</span> Landing On Ground</h3>
<p>The Meet Director, in agreement with the Safety Director and Chief Judge and after consultation with the Safety Committee can decide to eliminate the landing on the raft in the case of rough seas, very cold water (less than 10°C) or unsafe landing conditions.</p>
<p>In that case, a ground landing can be scored under the following conditions:</p>
<p>The pilots should be able to safely approach the landing area without over flying the public.</p>
<p>A target landing gives the “raft points”. The target must be 1m diameter minimum.</p>
<p>Ground spirals, raft flip, and all the synchro landing tricks are not allowed. All other landing tricks are allowed but must be safely performed, taking into consideration the nature of the landing area, the obstacle and people on ground.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.6.2" id="no-landing-scoring"><span class="header-section-number">5.6.2</span> No Landing Scoring</h3>
<p>If the conditions are not safe, the Meet Director, in agreement with the Safety Director and Chief Judge and after consultation with the Safety Committee can decide that landing will not be scored (0 for all pilots/pairs).</p>
<h2 data-number="5.7" id="synchronisation-1"><span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Synchronisation</h2>
<p>Synchronization is scored for the entire run, including the landing.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.8" id="manoeuvre-and-score-validation"><span class="header-section-number">5.8</span> Manoeuvre and Score Validation</h2>
<p>Just after completing the run, pilots/pairs are requested to validate their maneuvers by checking in at the judges’ tent.</p>
<p>When a run is completed the list of maneuvers and the provisional results are published on the official information board. The pilots/pairs have 1 hour time to check the scores and report to the judges to point out possible errors.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.9" id="obvious-error"><span class="header-section-number">5.9</span> Obvious Error</h2>
<p>The Meet Director may hold a conference with the judges to adjust a score in case of an obvious error.</p>
