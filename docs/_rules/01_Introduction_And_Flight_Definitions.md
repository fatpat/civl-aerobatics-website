Section 7B of the FAI Sporting Code is the subset of Section 7 (or
"Section 7 Common") dedicated to Paragliding Aerobatics Championships.
This document must be read in conjunction with the Section 7 Common,
Section 7I Guidelines and Templates, Section 7E WPRS (CIVL Ranking) and
the General Section.

This document defines rules for 1st Category Events. For 2nd Category
Events, see Section 7 Common Chapter 12.

## Flight Definitions

Additional definitions relevant to paragliding can be found in the
Section 7A Cross Country.

### Flight Box

A three dimensional virtual and variable space, within which all
maneuvers must take place. The flight box includes an area over the
water where a pilot must land in case he loses control of his glider or
throws his reserve parachute. The size and shape of the flight box is
highly dependent on weather conditions, especially wind drift. It is the
pilot's responsibility to monitor conditions closely during his flight
in order to ensure he is in, and stays in, the flight box during all
maneuvers.

The overall flight box area is defined and described during the General
Briefing. It may be adjusted later during the event.

### No-fly Zone

The area over which flying is strictly forbidden at all times,
irrespective of wind conditions. The no-fly zone is defined during the
General Briefing and may be adjusted later during the event.

In the case where the Flight Box includes part of a No-Fly Zone, the
rules of the No-Fly Zone prevail.
