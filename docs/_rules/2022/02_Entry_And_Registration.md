## Entry

The Local Regulations shall state:

* The maximum number of pilots that may be accepted in the Solo Championship.
* The maximum number of pairs of pilots that may be accepted in the Synchro Championship.
* The maximum number of pilots that may be entered by a NAC.

## Eligibility to Compete

In the 5 years preceding the start of the Championships:
* Men shall have scored a minimum of 25 WPRS points
* Women shall have scored a minimum of 20 WPRS points
* Synchro pairs must demonstrate their skill either in a previous event or just prior to the championship.

### Exemption to Eligibility to Compete

For any exemptions to pilot qualification requirements, applications
must be made by the pilot's NAC, with supporting evidence of the pilot's
skill and competition history. It is the responsibility of the NAC to
ensure this is received by the CIVL President at least 30 days before
the start of the competition.

The list of exempted pilots is published on the organizer's website.

The Meet Director, before the start of the competition, may request an
exempted pilot or a Synchro pair, to participate in a safety selection
to demonstrate the skills defined in [Safety Selection](##). In agreement with the
Safety Director and Chief Judge, he may refuse entry to the competition
if the pilot or the pair is unable to demonstrate these skills.

#### Safety Selection

All pilots entering the competition shall be able to safely perform the
following maneuvers:
* Full stall + exit
* Tail slide + exit
* Wingover
* SAT
* Helicopter

All pilots entering the competition shall be able to demonstrate the
following points of choreography:
* Placement and drift
* Management of altitude
* Flow, rhythm, connection
* Synchro co-ordination (only for synchro flights)

### Qualification Dates

Pilot qualifications must be finalized 30 days before the start of the
championship.

### Procedure for Checking Qualification

Qualification is to be checked by four parties to avoid unnecessary
travel, expenses and disappointment in the event that a pilot's entry is
rejected due to not meeting the qualification criteria:
* The NAC or National Association/Federation before selecting their pilots.
* The competition organiser.
* The pilot.
* The CIVL Screening Committee.

### CIVL Screening Committee

A Screening Committee is appointed by CIVL Bureau for each championship.
It consists of three people: one representing the Bureau, one
representing the Aerobatics Committee, and a Senior Judge.

The screening committee shall:
* Check that entries accepted by the organizer meet eligibility to compete criteria. Notify the organizer promptly of any that do not, so that the pilot can apply for an exemption under [Exemption to Eligibility to Compete](##).
* Accept and check applications for exemptions. Request additional information if needed, make decisions with safety in mind and inform NAC and organizers.
* Check that the allocation process is effected according to the rules.

It is each pilot's responsibility to make sure he is qualified.

### Organiser's Responsibility

It is the organizer's responsibility to notify NACs of any pilots who do
not appear to meet the qualification criteria.

## Allocation

The nation ranking for this purpose shall be the WPRS Nation Ranking
three calendar months before the championship starts.

Places are allocated to nations, one by one, in order from the top
nation in the WPRS nation ranking down to the last ranked nation; if any
places are still available, the process starts at the top again.

This process will continue until the maximum number of pilots is reached
or until 60 days before the start of the championship or otherwise
stated in the local regulations.

### Mixed Championships

The base for all nations is one male pilot plus one female pilot (1+1).

The allocation is done according to [Allocation](##), but in this process the place
allocated to the one female pilot in the base team size cannot be filled
by a male pilot in any round of allocation.

### Host nation

The host nation shall have the opportunity of entering the same number
of pilots as the top nation, except that in mixed championships they may
not enter males as substitutes for females with places allocated under
the 1+1 rule (see [Mixed Championships](##)).

Current World and Continental Champions, men and women, who are allowed
a discretionary entry to defend their title if not selected as part of
the national entry, are not taken into account in the number of pilots
of the top nation

## Registration

Each competitor will be required to present to the organizers upon
registration:
* Proof of identity.
* Satisfactory evidence of equipment airworthiness.
* Proof of valid insurance as detailed.
* Each competitor will be requested to sign:
* Waiver declaration (agreement on release of liability). See Section 7I Guidelines and Templates Chapter 12.
* Certified glider statement. See Section 7I Guidelines and Templates Chapter 16.
* Entry form.

Each competitor will be requested to present his equipment to be checked
by the Safety Director and/or a Senior Judge. In case of non-compliance
(see Chapter 8), the pilot might not be accepted.
